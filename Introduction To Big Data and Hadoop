## **Types of Digital Data**

Digital data is the information that is stored, processed, and transferred using computers. It is mainly divided into **three types**:

### **1. Structured Data**

* This is **well-organized data** that follows a fixed format.
* It is stored in rows and columns like in **databases, spreadsheets**.
* Easy to search, store and analyze.
* **Examples:** Student records, bank transactions, employee details.

### **2. Unstructured Data**

* This data **does not have a fixed format**.
* It is large, messy and difficult to analyze directly.
* It includes text, images, audio, video, social media posts, emails, etc.
* **Examples:** YouTube videos, WhatsApp messages, tweets.

### **3. Semi-structured Data**

* This data is **partly organized** but not in strict rows and columns.
* It has tags or markers that make it easier to understand.
* Often used in web applications.
* **Examples:** XML files, JSON data, HTML pages.

### **Short Conclusion**

Structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data are the three main types of digital data. They differ in format, organization, and how easy they are to process.
